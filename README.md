## Rebalancing and Minor Tweaks

__Rebalance:__ The gold mine usually gives you gold ore, stone, or golg coin in equal porportion (33%/33%/33%). This tweak makes the distribution 60%/20%/20% in favor of gold ore. You can disable this change in the mod's option screen.

__Tweak:__ Sheds, Warehouses, and Lighthouses can be mixed together in one stack.
