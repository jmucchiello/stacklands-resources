# Resources Mod Mode

Just a small mod that allows you to make and unmake resources.

## Actions
Weapons, buildings, and villagers are not consumed in these recipes.

### Flint
* 1x Stone, 1x Villager -> 1x Flint _in 10s_
* 1x Sandstone, 1x Villager -> 1x Flint _in 10s_

### Stone
* 1x Brick, 1x Hammer -> 2x Stone in _15s_

### Sand
* 1x Sandstone, 1x Hammer -> 2x Sand _in 15s_
* 1x Sandstone, 1x Axe -> 2x Sand _in 15s_
* 1x Glass, 1x Hammer -> 2x Sand _in 15s_

### Metals
* 1x Smithy, 1x Gold Bar, 1x Charcoal -> 1x Gold Ore _in 10s_
* 1x Smithy, 1x Iron Bar, 1x Charcoal -> 1x Iron Ore _in 10s_
* 1x Smelter, 1x Flint, 1x Charcoal -> 1x Iron Ore _in 10s_

### Sticks
* 5x Wood, 1x Villager -> 5x Stick _in 45s_
* 1x Lumber, 1x Axe -> 2x Stick _in 15s_

### Magic Dust
* 1x Gold Ore, 1x Sand, 1x Campfire, 1x Wizard/Mage -> 1x Magic Dust, 1x Wizards/Mage _in 60s_<br>(The campfire is destroyed. This recipe does not work on a stove.)

## Rebalancing

* The gold mine usually gives you gold ore, stone, or golg coin in equal porportion (33%/33%/33%). This tweak makes the distribution 60%/20%/20% in favor of gold ore. You can disable this change in the mod's option screen.
